        <h2>01 Entities</h2>

        <h3>01.1 Human (H)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>American infantry soldiers in World War II.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>01.2 Technology (T)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Machine guns, representative of the broader technological shift in warfare.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>01.3 World (W)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The battlefield, characterized by danger, chaos, and psychological stress.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>02 Mapping Interactions</h2>

        <h3>02.1 Use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Soldiers use machine guns (and other weapons) to engage the enemy, striving to achieve fire superiority.</li>
            <li>"The correct use of weapons by a formation in battle comes of the perfecting of controls over men who are physically beyond reach."</li>
            <li>Disconnect between technical operation and effective deployment in combat.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>02.2 Mediation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Machine guns transform the battlefield into a realm of overwhelming firepower and impersonal violence.</li>
            <li>Enemy becomes largely invisible, increasing the psychological impact of unseen threats.</li>
            <li>"The enemy fires. The transition of that moment is wholly abnormal. He had expected to see action. He sees nothing. There is nothing to be seen."</li>
            <li>Shifts focus from direct confrontation to psychological effects of unseen firepower.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>02.3 Interpretation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mediated experience clashes with soldier's initial interpretations shaped by training and societal expectations.</li>
            <li>Training emphasizes individual marksmanship and heroism; reality highlights collective action and psychological resilience.</li>
            <li>"The heart of the matter is to relate the man to his fellow soldier... when the ground offers him no comfort and weapons fail."</li>
            <li>Suggests misinterpretation needs correction through training that accounts for psychological impact of technology.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>03 Highlighting Dynamics</h2>

        <h3>03.1 Intermediary Role</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Machine gun technology acts as a powerful intermediary, shaping the relationship between soldiers and the battlefield.</li>
            <li>Creates a disconnect between expectation of visible enemies and reality of fighting an unseen, technologically empowered force.</li>
            <li>Influences soldier's psychological state, impacting willingness to engage and effectiveness of actions.</li>
            <li>"The challenge for military training then becomes accounting for this intermediary role of technology and preparing soldiers for the psychological realities of technologically mediated warfare."</li>
        </ul>
